# Facial Expression Recognition using PyTorch

![Cover image](un-transform.png)

Hello everyone, I hope you are doing well during these time. In this project, we're going to look at how to build a **facial expression recognition** project from scratch using PyTorch. We'll start from simple task such as downloading dataset, dataset preparation to writing our own custom CNN and a build a ResNet-9 for our use case. We'll also experiment with different learning rate schedulers. Hope you enjoy it.
